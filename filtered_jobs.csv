Create a web app using Azure to replace a traditional form,"Looking to create a web application that will be hosted in Azure using Azure technologies. The application will be replacing a manual form, currently users complete the form, sign it and then email it back. We are looking to modernise the process by creating an application. The workflow is as follows. 1. User opens the web application which will be secured using a certificate 2. Before completing the form, the user completes a multi factor authentication where a captcha phrase will be used to verify that they user is human and they provide their email address for the MFA process. 3. The next step is to open up a form to get the user to confirm their email address, they get to enter it twice with copy and paste disabled for the second input textbox so they have to type it in. 4. After this, an Azure process will get the email address, generate a random token number with 5 or 6 digits and send it to the users email address, the web app will then ask the user to confirm the number, if the number matches the user is presented with a form to complete which is the actual physical form but in a way of a web application. 5. The form should capture the IP address of the client and the date, so when the form was opened and when the form was submitted for processing. 6. The form should allow the user to sign the form either by typing their name and the date or by drawing their signature and the date. 7. After the form is submitted, a PDF file Is generated with the completed details, the form is then sent to us via email and the client so that they also have a copy of the details they provided. The PDF file should be FirstName_LastName_Application_Form_DDMMYYYYHHMM. The PDF form will also need to be stored within a storage account or Google drive. 8.

Encrypted Prompt Delivery API for Salesforce (Node + Apex),"N.B. You must have excellent English verbal communication skills as we will need to collaborate over video calls. If short-listed, you will be asked to attend a Google Meet with camera on. **PROJECT BRIEF** We are developing a number of proprietary AI agent products and require a secure method to deliver prompt content into Salesforce without exposing the actual prompt text. This project involves building a lightweight external API that returns AES-256 encrypted prompts, along with supporting logic to decrypt these inside Salesforce (Apex) at runtime. Deliverables 1) Encrypted Prompt API - REST endpoint (e.g. /prompt?id=agent_name) - Returns AES-256 encrypted prompt string - Uses API key/token to authenticate requests - Hosted on Heroku 2) Encryption Utility - CLI script (Node.js or Python) to encrypt new prompt strings using a shared key - Prompts can be stored in a JSON file or lightweight data store 3.
