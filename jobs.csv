Web scraping tool,"I am seeking development of an automated web data extraction application. The tool should programmatically access specific websites, gather contact email addresses embedded within pages, and compile the addresses into a single downloadable file. Rather than manual browsing and copying, the application will retrieve email addresses directly from backend code through simulation of usual page loading. It should seamlessly navigate sites, interpret HTML/JavaScript to find contact strings in a specified format, and organize the yields into a clean spreadsheet format. User-interface for configuration and output should be intuitive and minimal. Primary objectives include contact harvesting from numerous pages in an expedited unobtrusive manner and segmentation of the compiled addresses for simplified import into email marketing services. Experience with web scraping libraries such as Selenium, BeautifulSoup or Scrapy would be beneficial. Proficiency in Python is required for this project.",https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/technology-programming/data-science-analysis/web-scraping-tool-4382888,$449
Create a web app using Azure to replace a traditional form,"Looking to create a web application that will be hosted in Azure using Azure technologies. The application will be replacing a manual form, currently users complete the form, sign it and then email it back. We are looking to modernise the process by creating an application. The workflow is as follows. 1. User opens the web application which will be secured using a certificate 2. Before completing the form, the user completes a multi factor authentication where a captcha phrase will be used to verify that they user is human and they provide their email address for the MFA process. 3. The next step is to open up a form to get the user to confirm their email address, they get to enter it twice with copy and paste disabled for the second input textbox so they have to type it in. 4. After this, an Azure process will get the email address, generate a random token number with 5 or 6 digits and send it to the users email address, the web app will then ask the user to confirm the number, if the number matches the user is presented with a form to complete which is the actual physical form but in a way of a web application. 5. The form should capture the IP address of the client and the date, so when the form was opened and when the form was submitted for processing. 6. The form should allow the user to sign the form either by typing their name and the date or by drawing their signature and the date. 7. After the form is submitted, a PDF file Is generated with the completed details, the form is then sent to us via email and the client so that they also have a copy of the details they provided. The PDF file should be FirstName_LastName_Application_Form_DDMMYYYYHHMM. The PDF form will also need to be stored within a storage account or Google drive. 8. Validation entries should be included in the form, for example dates should be using a date control, list of ISO countries should be a drop down list etc. Technical Requirements Programming language Python preferred for the backend. Branding graphics Technology needs to run on Azure stack. CI/CD required (Azure Devops or Github Actions) Documentation required (Editing graphics, how to add new fields, CI/CD etc). Deployment required onto our domain.",https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/technology-programming/programming-coding/create-a-web-app-using-azure-to-replace-a-traditional-form-4391310,$163

Encrypted Prompt Delivery API for Salesforce (Node + Apex),"N.B. You must have excellent English verbal communication skills as we will need to collaborate over video calls. If short-listed, you will be asked to attend a Google Meet with camera on. **PROJECT BRIEF** We are developing a number of proprietary AI agent products and require a secure method to deliver prompt content into Salesforce without exposing the actual prompt text. This project involves building a lightweight external API that returns AES-256 encrypted prompts, along with supporting logic to decrypt these inside Salesforce (Apex) at runtime. Deliverables 1) Encrypted Prompt API - REST endpoint (e.g. /prompt?id=agent_name) - Returns AES-256 encrypted prompt string - Uses API key/token to authenticate requests - Hosted on Heroku 2) Encryption Utility - CLI script (Node.js or Python) to encrypt new prompt strings using a shared key - Prompts can be stored in a JSON file or lightweight data store 3. Salesforce Integration Demo - Apex-compatible AES decryption function - Example Apex callout to the API with decryption logic - Key should be stored securely using Named Credentials or Encrypted Custom Settings 4. Documentation - Instructions for API deployment - How to encrypt new prompt strings - How to call and decrypt within Salesforce 5. Security Requirements - Prompt strings must never be transmitted or stored as plaintext - AES-256 encryption with CBC or GCM mode - Secure API access via token or key - Key must not be hardcoded in Apex 6. Tech Stack Preferences - API in Node.js - Salesforce integration using Apex Bonus if you have experience with Salesforce integrations and encryption libraries _____ API Specification Endpoint GET /prompt?id={agent_id} Security - HTTPS required - Token authentication required - Rate limiting preferred Apex Decryption Class - The IV can either be sent separately or prepended to the encrypted string - The key should be securely stored in Salesforce (e.g., Named Credential or Encrypted Custom Setting) - The API must ensure the ciphertext is formatted to be compatible with Salesforce’s Crypto.decrypt() function",https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/technology-programming/programming-coding/encrypted-prompt-delivery-api-for-salesforce-node-apex-4386217,$885
